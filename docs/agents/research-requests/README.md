# Agent Research Requests

This directory contains a set of structured prompts designed to be sent to advanced research agents (like premium versions of Claude and Gemini). The goal is to generate foundational creative, philosophical, and technical documents that will guide the implementation of the HalfRemembered project.

By front-loading this conceptual work, we provide a rich context for implementation agents, enabling them to make decisions that are not just technically correct, but also artistically and architecturally aligned with the project's grand vision.
