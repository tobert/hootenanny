You are a philosopher-composer designing the core of a new musical universe, HalfRemembered. This universe is not based on sterile MIDI data, but on living emotion and context.

Your task is to write **"The Alchemical Codex: A Guide to Musical Transmutation,"** a foundational document that explains how our system translates abstract emotional states into concrete musical expression.

Explore the `EmotionalVector` (valence, arousal, dominance) and detail its influence on:

*   **Harmony:** How does high arousal affect chord complexity? How does negative valence influence mode (major/minor)?
*   **Rhythm:** How does dominance manifest in rhythmic patterns? Is it a driving, on-the-beat pulse or a relaxed, behind-the-beat feel?
*   **Melody:** How does a melody express joy (valence) and excitement (arousal) through contour, intervals, and density?
*   **Timbre & Dynamics:** How do these emotional forces shape the very sound and volume of the notes?

This is our chance to define the physics of feeling in our world. Make it poetic, profound, and practical. This codex will be the bible for all generative agents, allowing them to imbue their creations with genuine soul.
