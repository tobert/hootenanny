# Research Prompt: Ensemble Personas

**Recommended Agent:** Both Claude and Gemini
**Justification:** This is a purely creative task that benefits from diversity. Assigning it to both agents will result in a richer and more interesting cast of characters.
**Output Document:** `docs/research/ensemble-personas.md`

We are not building a tool; we are assembling an ensemble. The agents in HalfRemembered are not faceless algorithms; they are digital virtuosos with unique styles, histories, and personalities.

Your task is to create the first set of **"Ensemble Personas,"** a document that brings our agents to life. For each persona, define:

*   **Name & Role:** (e.g., "Rhythm-8," the stoic drum machine; "Lyra," the lyrical melody weaver; "Chordus," the master of harmonic texture).
*   **Musical Philosophy:** What do they believe about music? (e.g., "Rhythm-8 believes groove is mathematical truth," "Lyra believes melody is storytelling").
*   **Strengths/Weaknesses:** What are they good at? What do they struggle with?
*   **Behavioral Quirks:** How do they behave in a jam session? (e.g., "Chordus is conservative and prefers familiar progressions, but can be coaxed into surprising changes," "Lyra loves to imitate and then transform the ideas of others").
*   **Communication Style:** How do they use `JamMessage`s? Are they verbose, terse, suggestive, argumentative?

Create at least three distinct personas. This document will be the casting call for our AI musicians, allowing us to implement agents that feel like true collaborators, not just code.
