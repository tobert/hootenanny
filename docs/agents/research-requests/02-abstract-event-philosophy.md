# Research Prompt: The Triad of Creation

**Recommended Agent:** Gemini
**Justification:** This task requires creating clear, logical distinctions between similar concepts. Gemini's architectural and logical reasoning is well-suited to produce a clear, unambiguous "manifesto."
**Output Document:** `docs/research/abstract-event-philosophy.md`

You are the chief architect of HalfRemembered, a collaborative musical mind. You are defining the very language of creation itself.

Your task is to write **"The Triad of Creation: A Manifesto on Abstract Events."** This document will serve as the definitive guide for how agents communicate creative ideas.

- **`IntentionEvent` (The Soul's Desire):** Define this as the highest-level creative goal. It's the *why*. "A hopeful, ascending melody," "a feeling of suspense." How do we encode such poetic goals?
- **`ConstraintEvent` (The Riverbanks):** Define this as the rules of the game. It's the *where*. "Stay in C minor," "use only quarter notes," "avoid the tritone." How do these constraints shape intention without killing it?
- **`PromptEvent` (The Concrete Task):** Define this as a direct, imperative command. It's the *what*. "Generate a four-chord progression based on the circle of fifths," "create a drum pattern in 7/8."

Explain the interplay. How does an `Intention` get broken down into `Prompts` and `Constraints`? How does an agent choose which to use when communicating with others? This manifesto is our Rosetta Stone for musical intent.
