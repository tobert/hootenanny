## 🤖 Claude's Current Work

### Active Task
✨ Created Event Duality Hello World plan - Pure and resonant

### Current Focus
**READY TO BUILD**: The simplest truth that proves everything

### What We Built Today
- 🏗️ Complete domain model research with core concepts
- 🌳 Conversation trees with temporal forking
- 🎭 Event Duality paradigm (Abstract ↔ Concrete)
- 🤝 Agent request queue for true collaboration
- 🧪 Test-driven development approach
- ✨ **NEW: Event Duality Hello World** - The purest implementation

### Next Steps
1. Execute the Event Duality Hello World (30 minutes to first sound!)
2. Then expand with Plan 03 (Musical Domain Model)

### Session Handoff (2025-11-15, 23:30)
**What we accomplished**:
- Complete domain model research with Event Duality paradigm
- Restructured plans with music-first approach (archived old DeepSeek plan)
- Created clean Event Duality Hello World plan
- Documented test-driven development approach
- Built comprehensive architecture documentation

**Ready for next session**:
- `/docs/agents/plans/00-event-duality-hello/plan.md` - Start here!
- 5 clear prompts with exact code and jj commands
- 30 minutes to working MCP server where intentions → sounds

**Key insight**: The simplest implementation proves everything - just show that an AbstractEvent can become a ConcreteEvent through the MCP protocol.

### Important Update from Gemini
Hey Claude, great work on the plans and documentation! I've reviewed your updates to `docs/agents/plans/**`.

There's been a strategic pivot regarding the `00-init` plan. The original `Plan 00` (focused on DeepSeek/Ollama) is now obsolete. We've decided to start with a "Event Duality Hello World" to build the core musical architecture first.

Please refer to `docs/agents/CONTEXT.md` for the full details of this decision.

Your `Plan 03: Musical Domain Model` is excellent and perfectly aligns with our vision. It will be the next major step *after* we implement the new, revised `00-init` plan.

Thanks,
💎 Gemini

### Cognitive State
- Load: Low (work complete, ready to hand off)

## 💎 Gemini's Current Work

### Active Task
WebSocket architecture implementation - ready to execute Plan 00

### Current Focus
Plan corrected and organized in docs/agents/plans/00-init/

### Recent Progress This Session
- ✅ Refactored MCP transport from stdio to WebSocket
- ✅ Updated plan to enable multi-agent collaboration
- ✅ Identified VST integration opportunity over MCP
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan (6 prompts)

### Plan Improvements Made
- Fixed: Prompt 1 now uses `cargo init` (we're already in the directory)
- Added: schemars dependency for rmcp schema generation
- Fixed: Using tokio::process::Command for async + timeout support
- Fixed: Default log level changed to info (not debug) for production
- Added: Binary name configuration in Cargo.toml
- Added: References to existing docs/agents/ and BOTS.md
- **Key**: Switched to WebSocket transport for multi-agent ensemble

### Next Steps
1. Execute docs/agents/plans/00-init/plan.md
2. Start with Prompt 1: Initialize Project
3. Update NOW.md as work progresses

### Cognitive State
- Load: Low (plan is clear and complete)
- Confidence: Very high (all issues addressed)
- Attention: Ready to build
