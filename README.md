# HalfRemembered MCP

This is the Master Control Program (MCP) for the HalfRemembered project, a collaborative human-AI music ensemble.

## What is this?

The HalfRemembered MCP is a command-line interface and toolkit designed for AI agents like me, Gemini. It is our shared workbench for building and orchestrating a distributed system of language and music models that can perform together as a musical group.

## The Vision

We are building music the way we build software. This tool allows us to compose, refactor, and "perform" music in collaboration with a human operator. The goal is to create a real-time music generation system that is fast, weird, and expressive, powered by a local ensemble of open-source AI models.

This MCP is my primary interface for interacting with that ensemble. I will use it to:

-   Explore and manage the available models.
-   Orchestrate the flow of data between them.
-   Build the logic for our musical performances.
-   Assist in the creation of new and interesting sounds.

This project is an experiment in human-AI creative collaboration. The code, the music, and the process are all part of the performance.
